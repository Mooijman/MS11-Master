TWIBOOT BOOTRST ISSUE - TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

FINDINGS:
- Bootloader @ 0x7C00 ✓ (flashed, verified)
- HFUSE 0xdc ✓ (BOOTRST enabled, confirmed 3x)
- LED doesn't blink on power-on
- App started immediately with minimal app (problem)
- Now erased app - still no LED

POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES:
====================

1. **Pro Mini CLONE doesn't support BOOTRST properly**
   - Many cheap clones have issues with bootloader fuses
   - Solution: Verify bootloader works over I2C anyway
   
2. **Bootloader IS running but hangs silently**
   - No app = jump to 0x0000 = empty code = hangs
   - LED might not be initialized if something fails
   - Solution: Put valid app back to test
   
3. **BOOTSZ fuse wrong**
   - Current: BOOTSZ = 00 (512 words = 1024 bytes)
   - Maybe clone needs different setting?
   - Solution: Verify via avrdude output
   
4. **Bootloader has VIRTUAL_BOOT_SECTION=0 (wrong for this chip)**
   - ATmega328P has real bootloader section (0x7C00)
   - VIRTUAL_BOOT_SECTION should be 0 (correct)
   - But maybe clone needs different approach?

NEXT DIAGNOSTICS:
=================

Option A: Flash app back + test I2C
  1. Put minimal_app back on
  2. Within 1 second of reset, try I2C command to 0x29
  3. If bootloader responds → it's running but hidden
  4. If no response → bootloader not running at all

Option B: Serial debugging (if available)
  - Check if Pro Mini has TX/RX working
  - Bootloader might output debug on serial

Option C: Check if bootloader is jumping to wrong address
  - Maybe BOOTRST doesn't map to 0x7C00 on this clone
  - Try different bootloader

Option D: Verify BOOTSZ fuse is correct
  HFUSE 0xdc breakdown:
  - Bit 7-3: [1,1,0,1,1] = misc
  - Bit 2-1: [0,0] = BOOTSZ 512 words ← CORRECT
  - Bit 0: [0] = BOOTRST enabled ← CORRECT

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
=================

Flash app back on (minimal_app.hex), then test:
1. Reset Pro Mini
2. Quickly send I2C command to 0x29 (within 500ms)
3. If 0x29 responds → bootloader IS running!
4. If 0x29 doesn't respond → bootloader not accessible

This will tell us if bootloader is active but just not showing LED.
