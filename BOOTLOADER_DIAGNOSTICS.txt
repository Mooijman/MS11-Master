BOOTLOADER DIAGNOSTICS
======================

FUSES: ✅ CORRECT
  hfuse: 0xdc (BOOTRST enabled - bootloader is default)
  lfuse: 0xc2 (8MHz internal RC oscillator)
  efuse: 0xfd (2.7V BOD)

BOOTLOADER: ✅ FLASHED
  Size: 1.4 KB (1024 bytes)
  Located: 0x7C00 (bootloader section)

PROBLEM: No LED blink on reset
  → Bootloader might be starting but without LED indication
  → OR bootloader is jumping directly to app without activation

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
===============

1. **Bootloader has no LED_SUPPORT enabled**
   - Check if twiboot was compiled with -DLED_SUPPORT=1
   - Current compilation might have had LED disabled

2. **Bootloader code issue**
   - main.c line 134: #if (LED_SUPPORT) 
   - If disabled, no visual feedback
   - Bootloader still active on I2C 0x29, just invisible

3. **App area corrupted**
   - If app flash is empty/invalid, bootloader might hang
   - No LED = no clue it's running

TEST PLAN:
==========

Method A: Check if bootloader is ACTUALLY running (0x29 detection)
  1. Reset Pro Mini
  2. IMMEDIATELY (within 500ms) open ESP32 I2C Scanner
  3. Look for 0x29
  4. If found → bootloader IS running! (just no LED feedback)
  5. If not found → bootloader isn't starting at all

Method B: Force LED support rebuild
  If Method A fails (no 0x29 detection):
  1. Edit main.c: #define LED_SUPPORT 1
  2. Rebuild: make MCU=atmega328p
  3. Reflash: make MCU=atmega328p AVRDUDE_PROG='-c usbtiny -P usb' install
  4. Reset and look for LED blink on PB4 (Arduino D12)

Method C: Check app flash area
  1. Read entire flash again
  2. Check bytes 0x0000-0x7BFF
  3. If all 0xFF → app area is empty (normal on fresh board)
  4. Bootloader will wait 1 second then jump to empty code (hangs?)

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
=================

Do this NOW:
1. Reset Pro Mini
2. Within 500ms, check ESP32 I2C Scanner
3. Report: Do you see 0x29 or not?

This will tell us if bootloader is running silently (just no LED).
